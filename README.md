<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Install server/api and client dependencies. [ both, api and client directories ]</p>

```

<p>2. Set your environment variables in an .env file.</p>
- GET AN API KEY HERE = https://thedogapi.com/

```.env

DB_PASSWORD=??? 
DB_HOST=???

<p>3. If you are NOT using PostgreSQL install the necessary dependencies and change the Sequelize connection in => api/src/db.js</p>
<a href="https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#connecting-to-a-database" target="_blank">More info on how to do this</a>

```js
const {   DB_USER DB_PASSWORD DB_HOST DB_NAME } = process.env;  

// ? PostgreSQL connection: Use your environment variables.
const sequelize = new Sequelize(`postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/${DB_NAME}`, {
  logging: false, // ? set to console.log to see the raw SQL queries
  native: false, // ? lets Sequelize know we can use pg-native for ~30% more speed
});
```

<p>4. Run the application!. [Both, first the api and then the client]</p>

```shell
npm start
```
